# Face-based Attendance System-Backend  

This application is for teachers.Here they can verify their email then create their account.They can manage their students to their class.They can mark the attendance of the multiple students at a time by clicking thir photo.They can also see the attendance of the students of their class. 

This repository contains the backend service for a real-time, face-based attendance system. Built with FastAPI, this robust API handles user authentication, student management, face registration with alignment checks, and attendance marking through facial recognition.


## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Secure User Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for     teachers, including registration, login, logout, and account deletion functionalities.

* **Secure Password Management**: Hashing for all user passwords and a secure OTP-based flow for password resets.

* **Email Verification**: Ensures valid teacher accounts by using an OTP verification system before allowing registration.

* **Student Management**: Teachers can add, view, and delete students associated with their account.

* **Advanced Face Processing**: Before registering a student's photo, the system performs a liveness/alignment check to ensure high-quality data. It verifies head pose by checking eye-line angle, mouth-to-nose ratio, and jawline symmetry.

* **Real-time Attendance Marking**: Marks attendance for multiple students from a single class photo by detecting and identifying all faces present.

* **Comprehensive Attendance Reporting**: Fetch attendance records for individual students or download a complete attendance report in CSV format for a given date range.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project leverages a modern and efficient tech stack:

* **Backend Framework**: FastAPI

* **Database**: PostgreSQL

* **ORM**: SQLAlchemy

* **Data Validation**: Pydantic

* **Authentication**: JWT tokens and OAuth2 password flow

* **Password Hashing**: Passlib with bcrypt

* **Face Recognition**: InsightFace (buffalo_l model)

* **Image Processing**: OpenCV & NumPy

* **Caching & OTPs**: Redis is used to store OTPs and denylist JWTs upon logout.

* **Email**: smtplib for sending OTP and confirmation emails.

* **Containerization**: Docker


## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

1. **Teacher Registration**: For a teacher creating new account they must first verify their email address.Their email address is verifies as--
* They request an OTP (/send-email-verification-otp), which is sent to their email and stored in Redis.
* After submitting the correct OTP (/verify-email-confirm-otp), their email is marked as verified in the database.
They can then create an account with a user ID and password (/create_user).

2. **Authentication**: Teachers log in using their email and password to receive a JWT access token. This token must be included in the header for all subsequent protected requests. The logout functionality denylists the token in Redis until it expires, preventing reuse.

3. **Adding Students**: A teacher can add students to the class. This requires submitting the student's name, roll number, and a clear photo. The backend processes the image to ensure only one face is present and that it is clear and well-aligned(i.e., not tilted or turned). If the checks pass, the facial embedding (a vector representation of the face) is generated and stored in the database.

4. **Marking Attendance**: To take attendance, the teacher uploads a single photo of the classroom. The system detects all faces in the image and generates embeddings for each one. It then calculates the cosine similarity between the detected faces and the stored embeddings of all students registered to that teacher. If the similarity for a given student exceeds a predefined threshold (face_attendance_similarity_threshold), they are marked as present for the current date. The system is optimized to not mark students who are already marked present for the day.

5. **Fetching Attendance**: Teachers can view the attendance record for a specific student or download a complete CSV report for all their students, filterable by a date range.
